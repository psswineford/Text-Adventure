Text Adventure Game  - Shawn Swineford

Objective

I want to create an interactive “text adventure game”.  I have a passion for tabletop games and storytelling. My inspiration is to take the old Zork style text adventure games and update them with some interactivity. There would be 4 screens. One with a map showing where you are and where you can go. Another with a character information screen. One with clickable buttons that allow you to interact with the area. And the final screen would be a text area that updates as you move through the game.

Current Tech Stack:

Front-end
  Javascript to run game code
  HTML to display
  CSS for formatting


Future Tech Stack:  as I move forward I will convert to this tech stack to gain experience

Back-end
  mongoDB database – probably firebase
  Node.js server (Express)
Front-end
  React
  JSX
  HTML 
  CSS

User Stories

As a user I want to be able to see character information update as I get items and fight monsters in the world
As a user I want to see a map and text description of the current area I’m in
As a user I want to have clickable buttons that allow me to interact with the world (IE search the area, move to a new area, fight a monster)


Early goals:

My initial idea is to create a simple map with 4 rooms.  Each area will contain a description of the room, and things in it. 2 rooms will contain monsters to fight and 1 room will contain an item to help defeat the final monster. This should help me start simple and hopefully get me to a point where I’m ready to scale up.
